# How to set up sphinx and compile docs from scratch

This will document the whole process, if it's not needed just find the relevant step

First install `sphinx`

```bash
python -m pip install Sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme
```

Then the easiest thing is to run `sphinx-quickstart --ext-autodoc` (make sure autodoc is added)

We need to add the path of our modules to `sys.path` (there is a template autogenerated in `conf.py`,
something like `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../../genki_wave'))`

Since we are using Google style docstrings we also need to include the `napoleon` extension to
render them properly and use `sphinx_rtd_theme` since these google style docstrings do not
render correctly with the default theme

Then to automatically generate the docs for our module run `sphinx-autodoc`, example:
```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source genki_wave/
```

and finally to build it all run
```bash
cd docs
make html
```
